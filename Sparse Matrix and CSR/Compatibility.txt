This directory contains 3 files, if we ignore the file that is opened right now.

   All Scipts must be considered as modules in order to use the function. (Only for non-interactive execution)

   Index.py: This file is considered as Python Module. So you must run the python from this directory or to reach this directory
   using python's directory change command. Otherwise, the python code of Compressed_Sparse_Row.py and Sparse_Matrix.py is not going
   to run at all.
